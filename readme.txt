we are trying to simulate a human being, who can realy understand things in human's way.

every neuron have two features:
1.strength
2.the liklyhood with other neurons.

between neurons there are three methonds:
1.if two neuron is highly alike, then one will replace another to input or output.
2.if an neuron is not aliked by anyone or at a very low level, it will be forgotton.
3.every time a neuron is used, it will be stonger.
